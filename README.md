# consumerPriceIndexForecast
Creating and using a regression model using Python to forecast changes to the Consumer Price Index

Initially I used the sklearn module to create a linear regression model. This was just to use as a baseline, and is not appropriate for data, as it does not account for expected fluctuations and just mirrors the general trend over time.
